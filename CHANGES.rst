Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each interval binning
release.


Version 1.0.0
-------------

Release date to be decided.

Initial release as the interval binning package. Code refactored slightly from
my old region binning script focussed on genomic regions. The original script
used one-based positioning, but this package follows Python indexing and
slicing (zero-based, open-ended).
